Repo for NinjaTrader8 indicators and systems

Requires NT8.1 major release.

DDPlotReader - read any indicator on chart and send to trade managers such as TickHunter, Alighten's TradePanel or DDATM
DDObjectBreak - converts objects on chart to plot signals
DDATM - sample order management strategy you can use to process your orders with statistics. (WIP)



AlightenButtonPanelV0001.cs
What it is: A custom button panel that plugs into Chart Trader. It adds buttons for bracketing, flattening, moving stops/targets, etc.
How to use: Add AlightenButtonPanelV0001 as an indicator to your chart. Make sure Chart Trader is open, and the panel will appear with its custom buttons. Use the “Bridge Endpoint” property if you want other indicators (like DDPlotReader) to talk to it.
DDATM.cs
What it is: A strategy/indicator that routes signals to your ATM strategy logic (DimDim ATM).
How to use: Apply DDATM to a chart or let DDPlotReader send signals to it by selecting the DDATM destination. Configure the “Endpoint” so DDPlotReader knows which DDATM instance to talk to.
DDObjectBreak.cs
What it is: A breakout detector. It watches drawing objects (rectangles, lines) on your chart and emits a signal when price crosses them.
How to use: Add the indicator to a chart. Pick the drawing tag you want it to monitor. When price crosses that object, it outputs a +1/-1 signal (shown in the panel and available to other indicators like DDPlotReader).
DDPlotReader.cs
What it is: A signal router. It reads the output of other indicators (like DDObjectBreak) and sends entries/exits to TickHunter, DDATM, or the Alighten button panel.
How to use: Add it to the chart containing DDObjectBreak (or whichever indicator you want to monitor). In the DDPlotReader UI:
Select the indicator plot (e.g., “DDObjectBreak • BreakSignal”)
Toggle SEND on
Choose the destination (TickHunter, DDATM, or ABP)
When a signal occurs, DDPlotReader sends the appropriate command to the chosen trade panel.
TickHunterBridge.cs
What it is: A bridge between DDPlotReader and the TickHunter trade panel. It exposes a “bridge endpoint” so external indicators can trigger TickHunter buttons programmatically.
How to use: Apply TickHunterBridge to the same chart as TickHunter. Set its endpoint name (e.g., “th-default”). In DDPlotReader, set the endpoint to match. When DDPlotReader sends a signal to TickHunter, the bridge converts it into the appropriate TickHunter command (BuyPop, SellDrop, etc.).
Getting started flow for novice users:
Draw your breakout zones on the chart.
Add DDObjectBreak to detect the breakout.
Add DDPlotReader to read the breakout signal and route it.
Add your trade panel (TickHunter + TickHunterBridge, or AlightenButtonPanelV0001, or DDATM).
Configure the endpoints so DDPlotReader knows which panel instance to talk to.
Enable SEND in DDPlotReader, pick the destination, and watch the signals execute automatically.

For DDATM, you will need to load the DDATM strategy and enable - ATM button the Plot Reader is used for that mode.

For Alighten's Trade panel, you will need to load the ABPBridge indicator on the same chart as the panel. - ABP button on the Plot Reader is used for that mode.

For TickHunter order management tool, join TradeLikeAZombie discord https://discord.gg/eVcPStRR - TH button on the Plot Reader is used for that mode.

NOTE: If you add the TickHunterBridge, you will need to patch the latest Tickhunter with the diff included - either use WinMerge or just add the code manually from the patch.

The TickHunter version this was ran against was 1.504 as of time of this writting.
